Assignment for college class "MS211", at Universidade Estadual de Campinas - 2nd semester of 2015.

Usina Cantareira's database of water levels between 2003 and 2015 is explored and modeled using Least Squares Fitting techniques. Also, a method for solving a specific Heat Equation was implemented - though similar strategies can be used for generic problems.

Note: the assignment was developed entirely in portuguese.
